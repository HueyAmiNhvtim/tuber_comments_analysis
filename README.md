This is one of my projects done for my CS class.
In this, I tried to analyze the most common words or emotes used by commenters during and after streams of two Youtube streamers
You will want to run the visualization\_words\_freq.py to get the outputs which are a bunch of graphs made in pygal...
Hope you can find something interesting in it...
I also include the raw JSON files from 40-video worth of comments from each streamer.

Requirements:
\pygal
\regex
\Python3.8 or higher
