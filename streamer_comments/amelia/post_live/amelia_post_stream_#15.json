If it weren\u2019t for one of the expansions technically taking place after the main story. But Skyrim side quests just don\u2019t pack that punch the Witcher 3 quests do. There\u2019s no human feeling to 90% of the characters. And FUCK I can\u2019t think of a single meaningful decision you make in the story. But with the Witcher 3 it is packed to the gills with details and changes that occur within hundreds of decisions all over the game.

Become or not a lord vampire.Join basically every guild or institution you want. Killing or not your enemies. Being the good guy or not. Actually in skyrim the decision are not limitated to say one thing or other in any moment feel like you have the control of your own story.

Yeah you \"take\" decisions but only when the game want you to do it.", "@Carlos Arturo Mosquera Delgado and a lot of those decisions don\u2019t actually have any effect on anything. What actually changes when you become head of all those guilds. Pretty much nothing. What happens when you decline a quest in the Witcher? The state of an entire city changes. Your choices going forward change. And Skyrim gives you plenty of binary choices too. All I\u2019m saying when it comes to quests, the decisions made and their consequences, the Witcher 3 is more finely detailed and impactful. Skyrim the only real meaningful decision I can think of is kill the vampires or blot out the sun", "@Riastradh do not have effect? Man im just stopping right here. You looking like never played Skyrim for saying that kind of stuff... The last thing I have to say it's. Again witcher it's a pretty good game. Really overhyped not sure for what but still pretty good. But when it comes to games is as subjective as music. And for me its just another good game that I really would not play more than one.

I dearly hope so", "I'm here for the archive. But why is there no live chat replay?", "Takes several hours for youtube to process. The longer the stream the more it takes. Why  does it take so long for text but not for the video itself? Only youtube knows really.\n\nThe streamer can also leave it unavailable so that they can moderate it and then put it up later.

So she seduced Geralt. Not like him or Yennifer are exactly faithful...", "Ayy she fixed the title. It was Le'ts Begin before.

She will love it.", "I feel kind of the same, sadly. Her mouse sensitivity in combat makes it especially hard to watch, too."]
