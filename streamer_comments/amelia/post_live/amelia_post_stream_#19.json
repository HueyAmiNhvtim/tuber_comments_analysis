["I was a bit sleep deprived which made me a little cranky this stream; chat is chat and even with rules, mods, or filter, people will find a way to do whatever they want.

I hope this hasn't ruined The Witcher for you and I would understand if you don't want to stream it anymore. Take rest!", "I swear you girls are such sweethearts! We don\u2019t deserve you guys, yet you guys are here to have fun and bring cheer to us viewers! You being sleep deprived is to be expected since you\u2019re collaborating with the others in different time zones. You girls work so hard than we may realize. All we can do is support, and help you in anyway we can! Member or not, we\u2019re here for you Ame and everyone else in Hololive!", "It's good to put a sticky to warn the backseaters about chat rules. I hope you still enjoy the game!", "This is why a lot of twitch channels have a large number of mods to enforce rules. Rules can span anywhere from no back seating unless requested to don\u2019t talk about politics. I know there\u2019s a different culture on YouTube and Hololive and there\u2019s a risk of over banning with volunteer mods, but that\u2019s why heavy moderation is common.\nEdit: Also, I wanted to reiterate that you didn\u2019t let anyone down today. I really liked your joke about your biceps being too big.", "Don't apologize. Bastards deserved to be yelled at for their constant badgering.", "You were in the right to be angry.

You didn't let anyone down. If I was you I would have ended the stream much sooner tbh. We just want you to enjoy the game. Don't listen to trolls and spammers.

If chat bothers you to much, just ignore them. Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games but I understand if you want to stream it less often. I'll still watch whatever you put out so stay strong ok.

If anything backseaters can get bullied a bit tbh!", ":(", "Dont care about the bad side Amelia, we really like you and your streams", "Rest well ame, we will always keep supporting you, chat will behave i believe in the teamates", "We don't blame you at all. This issue was on chat not knowing when to stop. Please don't worry too much about it.", "Ame you haven't let anyone down, it's not your fault that some idiots can't follow the rules.

Come on now. This isn't the solution. Your chat will permanently be like this if left unchecked.", "You didn't let anyone down. You also have no reason to apologize.

It's fine to be harsh on chat if we're being too demanding or unruly, it's your stream and your game after all, not ours. There's no need to apologize to us, you did a good job today.", "Here to join the mob that's telling you  you have nothing to apologize for.

There are just some people who don't understand that watching someone play a game is about sharing their experience.  And it is not YOUR experience if people are demanding you do it their way.  You're a grown woman, you're a gamer, and your decisions and your choices are yours to make and we should not influence them unless you specifically ask for our opinion or help.  I will continue to support you in every, way, shape, and form I can.", "Ame, just ignore the chat unless you really need help, you frustrations is totally a right reaction, but please control your temper too.

The chat deserved it. It's not wrong to scold the chat when they are overdoing it. Even if some of us would still act like nothing is wrong. The real fans know and will heed the rules.

Just keep playing the game your own way, and keep your head up.", "Here's a haiku for you:\n\nIt was a fun stream\nNo, you did not let us down", "Nothing to apologize for!! \ud83d\ude0a Chat was going way overboard. I wouldn't have lasted nearly as long as you did before saying something. Witcher is meant to be played however you want to, and that's what I, for one, enjoy watching.

Do whatever makes you happy!! \ud83d\ude42", "This is no way your fault Ame, people should know better but I guess not.", "Awwww, don't worry Ame. We all have our cranky days and chat is annoying anyways. Get some mods for temporal bans (permanent would be too harsh) and they will calm down.", "I think we the chat, let you down more in this chat than you ever had let us down. Especially with how much you have prepped for this stream for us. I don\u2019t dare fault you for this, and I'm sure many others feel the same. Ultimately, it's your call on how you want to continue Witcher, and we understand whichever choice you make.", "Nothing to apologise for Ame! There's always room for improvement, but chat went a little overboard this time with the spam, nothing you can be blamed for", "You're okay Amelia. I'm not asking a question, I'm just telling you that you're doing fine, and don't fall apart thinking you're not. \n\nDon't fret about taking a breath before getting back on stage okay?

Don't blame yourself for being annoyed with chat misbehaving.", "It is okay Ame, it okay sometimes to put your foor down when necessary", "Ame, you did nothing wrong and it was us in the wrong.

I understand you might be trying to defuse the situation because of the backlash to chat, but don't blame it on yourself. Get some rest!\nI'd understand it if you would want to drop the game even if I like it; I feel it's not the best stream game due to length and other reasons like these.

Don't be too hard on yourself for the chat's behavior. I feel there's nothing wrong with sticking it to them when they act up.

If you have fun, we'll have fun too.", "No worries. It's not your fault some people can't be respectful.", "That was on us too.

I know you're not to blame for chat being chat but there is still some responsibility on your end since it's inevitable. You need try to enforce yourself more/step in when it's needed, or ignore it. I've seen so many Twitch VODS ruined because chat is spastic and the streamer is bad at managing it (which is definitely a skill a streamer develops, good chats don't fall out of the sky), I hope it doesn't lead towards this.
