Instead, explain to her why you want her to do your request. \n\nHonestly, it gets really annoying when chat backseats her, or any of the girls for that matter.

BUT, she will ASK if she needs to, i still can't believe some chat still said 'Eat', 'Alt+F4', and something similar like, dude, Ame knows it, you don't need to tell her or troll her.

I would like to point out though that the main message I was trying to get across is not what you've stated. \n\nYes, it's important to include the WHY when helping someone out. And Minecraft is a game where people like to explain how things work. But I was trying to get across that Minecraft is a game that thrives when players are the ones actively in charge of their own exploration and problem solving, yet almost paradoxically requires outside intervention to fully explore.
