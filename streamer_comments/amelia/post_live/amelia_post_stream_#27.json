I was talking about people who specifically can't tolerate a movie of even this level.

Hereditary isn't even that disturbing compared to horror movies of the past.", "@MKP2W I mean phobia, PTSD, mental issues, and emotional factors exist, and it's completely fine to find something disturbing and not tolerate these kind of movies even it's literally just props.. not everyone is as logical or as rational as you, bro.", "@MKP2W Welcome to humanity! Where people have different level of scares and tastes! Amazing, right? Can't believe that this was scary to some. Wow! So amazing!", "@JagBone The ratio of people who find this \"too disturbing\" has increased.  Pretty soon movies like Hereditary and The vvitch will be replaced with Monster House.

Its people changing.  Even the old classic \"The Exorcist\" movie is more graphic than Hereditary.  The movie had a young possessed girl stabbing her genitals with scissors.  Compare that to your goofy floating people of Hereditary, then think about people saying HEREDITARY was too disturbing.", "@MKP2W I'm pretty sure some people find the exorcist scary as all hell too doesn't mean anything...
