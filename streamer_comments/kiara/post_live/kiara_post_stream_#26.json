They aren't fond of western streamers streaming their games either, but they aren't going to waste money filing international lawsuits for copyright unless they are massive like Nintendo so most western streamers can get away with streaming Japanese games without any issue. And I'm sure you've heard how crazy Nintendo is about people streaming their games and their special partnership program from a couple years ago where they were taking 40% of the revenue from Nintendo content creators. Keep in mind this program was intended to be their COMPROMISE for the outrage caused by them copyright claiming and striking pretty much every streamer and content creator that included even a small amount of game footage in their videos(thankfully they've reversed their stance in the last couple of years). In the west companies now often sponsor and pay the streamers to play through and advertise their new games, but it is still very different in Japan.
