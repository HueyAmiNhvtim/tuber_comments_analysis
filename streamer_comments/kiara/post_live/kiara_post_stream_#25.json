["Don't listen to the people saying you're underlevelled and need to grind. You're not and you don't. You're on normal mode that means you already get extre exp. That means you're pretty much guaranteed to be overlevelled anyway. Levelling even more will take any challenge out of the game. What you have is uneven distribution of exp. Byleth and Edelgard are extremely overlevelled and others at around the right level. Only Linhardt is actually underlevelled because you rarely attack with him. ", "This right here.
