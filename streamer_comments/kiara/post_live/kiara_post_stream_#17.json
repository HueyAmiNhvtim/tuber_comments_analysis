There's another YT channel that discussed this, but Kiara was the reason the first collab stream finally kicked off and they all started to break out of their shell a bit.

This is why speed has the reputation of being the most important stat in FE games. \nThis is also part of why light weight weapons like iron and swords are almost always better than heavy ones like steel and axes. Heavy lowers your speed. The lighter weapons also usually have a better hit rate. Petra fought axe users, who are slow and have a bad hit rate, while she is fast and dodges well.
