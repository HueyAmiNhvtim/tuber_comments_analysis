That CPU is only 4 cores and first gen Ryzen at that so it's really unsuitable for comfortable streaming. Six cores should be a minimum for that purpose. It was funny to me so many in chat said this GPU is worse than 1050Ti ... are they trolling or what. RX580 is at least 50% faster than 1050Ti and 8gig vram version gets less bottlenecked in modern games too. But that's all in context of manager's PC, she'll definitely get a better one. Like 3700X + 2070S and 32 gigs of ram would make a very solid and cost efficient setup. New stuff is around the corner though too...", "Kiara don't worry about technical issue don't be so hard on yourself T_T !

It wasn't dying the whole time.", "I thought it was fun :)", "@Dr Nowzaradan i didnt mean entertainment wise i meant on a technical level", "She gave up lmao\n\nCause of lag kusa", "we will forgive you\n\u2026", "Kiara...........", "I wish you didn't decide to put some streams behind a paywall :( i wish i  had enough money to donate.", "Have some dignity you're a grown woman.", "Dignity?
