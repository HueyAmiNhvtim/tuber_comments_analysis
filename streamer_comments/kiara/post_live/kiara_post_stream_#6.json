It's not wasteful, not at all. And it's pretty tilting that you need to depend on someone for a collab on your own channel. I know you're learning but I hope this isn't a permanent thing.

If you want to have an attitude over free entertainment, you're not the kind of person anyone wants to be around. It's also weak in substance and doesn't provide anything helpful.", "@Mexican Honoka I think it\u2019s more due to the fact that the main comment comes off as rude and condescending rather than actual criticism. I do agree that I hope Kiara\u2019s PC issues are fixed soon and she\u2019s already addressed it I believe. Idk, there are better ways to comment constructive criticism.", "@ColdMoviez Yeah true, he needed to word it better, all I'm saying is don't combat hate with hate", "Kinda agree with the first, the second will hopefully get resolved in the near future, she's been having technical difficulties for a while now.\n\nNow, I love shipping a lot, part of the reason I got dragged into the Hololive rabbit hole was the yuri shipping. I feel like Kiara and Calli are an amazing ship lore-wise but their chemistry in stream is a little off putting because half of the time it's played for laughs and the other half a it causes somewhat awkward moments, I remember in their very first collab a very awkward silence was about settle in before Kiara went \"ANYWAYS\". Ironically, when Calli is NOT trying to go all tsundere on Kiara are the moments I like the most.", "@Mexican Honoka For sure! I think people are just being more defensive than usual due to Kiara already bringing up the issues on her other streams. I hope things iron out soon though!", "Imagine crying over free entertainment.", "@Doit XI it's 100% a bit dude. And \"shipping\" real people that have real relationships is horrible.", "@Zanpa shipping the characters is ok IMO, as long as one understands the character and the VA are two different entities. Thematically speaking, an immortal phoenix in love with the grim reaper is a super interesting concept I can totally get behind, but again some of their interactions rub me the wrong way."]
