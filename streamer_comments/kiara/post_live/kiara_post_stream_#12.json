Monsters that have all armor squared broken can't do damage for both your and their next full turns.

The Lance was Sylvain's special weapon which you can get later.", "Just a tip for an edit here ; Im pretty sure saying which artifact belongs to which character in a game with a story circling said artifacts is kind of a big SPOILER >_> good tips/clarifications overall though.", "Bitte was", "Wow, the translation is so disappointing in this game. Taming it down for western audiences is condescending to begin with but some of the lines they decided to censor are kind of offensive. Dorothea saying being with a woman might be more chill gets translated into her saying it might be nice to have you look after her? It's like it's purposefully trying to not acknowledge that it'd be a lesbian relationship. I guess we'll see how it goes since I'm assuming the translation team weren't able to edit out having female waifu as a female MC but if they keep toning it down like this, I'd suspect they would if they could. Reminds me of sentiments where gay couples were referred to as just being 'good friends'. Glad Kiara is here to put a light on this sort of bad, possibly politically motivated, translation.", "Not having played this game but having played awakening, fates, and echoes, is the point of this game still the strategy or is it a an actuall dating sim now? Its kind of odd...", "It\u2019s very much both.", "Intelligent Systems took a ton of cues from Persona when developing this game. The game is now firmly divided between the monastery life aspects of the game and the tactical battles, much like how the school life and dungeon crawling aspects of the Persona games are separate parts of the game yet feed into one another; you have to foster relationships with your students and train them outside of battle in order for them to do better during story or side missions that involve tactical combat.", "@ShunkenOne Yep, and using characters together in battle helps them build stronger relationships in the monetary sections. It\u2019s an interesting feedback loop.", "I see, sounds more interesting than I made it out to be.", "Oi", "I really like this streams", "Im broke so I help by liking and commenting", "Sorry I couldn't join the stream", "Ah yes potato asmr"]
