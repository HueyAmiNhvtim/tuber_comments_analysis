I know Kiryu Coco does, but is it the norm? I also know that Amelia, Kiara, Calli, and sometimes Gura, but I don't think I ever heard Ina swear. Maybe hololive En is just exceptionally swearing a lot of the time. It's probably due to the long form of the streams. I'm willing to bet the ideal is to make money from ads and superchat. Ad revenue is typically shot down when YouTube catches a swear. Maybe YouTube should cut some slack for longer forms of content. There is the 1 minute rule that I heard about.
